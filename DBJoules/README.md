# Queries Documentation
1. queries.py file consists of the queries used for the conducting the experiments using DBJoules.
2. For every dataset used in the experimentation, we have used four query lists each corresponding to a single database system.
3. Each list consists of five queries indicating the five operations that we experimented with, which are SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and JOIN.
4. The query lists particular to a single dataset are seperated by comments in the order: Netflix Userbase, Online Retail and International Energy Statistics.
5. The user needs to comment out the respective query lists while using the particular dataset.
6. These query lists are incorporated by main_app.py for conducting the experiments.
7. Other than the queries used for experimentation, some other example queries which are supported by DBJoules are presented in the example_queries.docx.
